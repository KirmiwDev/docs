# Authorization

Being a semi-private API does not mean that it is difficult to use or worse than others.\
The API is semi-private as you need an access key to make requests. We decided to implement this measure to keep our API as <mark style="color:green;">**secure**</mark>, <mark style="color:blue;">**optimized**</mark> and <mark style="color:purple;">**professional**</mark> as possible.

### Our methods to authorizate

We're using **HEADERS** in the http request as an authorization method, depending your library the way to do this can change.\
The **HEADER NAME** is called **`Authorization` ** and the value must be your API key..

### How to get an API key?

Easy... just join our [**support server**](https://discord.com/invite/3pT2WHG9EG)**,** create a ticket and provide us with the following information:

1. **Language/Library/App/Area you uso develop your application.**
2. **Package/Function/Plugin you will use to make the http requests.**
3. **A valid reason to use our API.**
4. **Some examples about http request using headers.**
5. **Basic programming knowledge.**

Thats all**,** if you pass the test you will get your key, otherwise the ticket will be closed.
